# Admission-Prediction

This is an application developed to predict the chance of admission for different data records based on multiple features like 'GRE SCORE', 'TOEFL SCORE', 'University Rating', 'SOP', 'LOR, 'CGPA', etc.
A machine learning model was built to predict the chance of admission.
EDA was done on the dataset provided by the client to preprocess the data through Panda-Profiling.
Then, the application was developed and deployed on the cloud platforms.
A simple Front-End was also built for this application.
Model building was done in a jupyter notebook which is attached to the repository.
